tennis-ball-tracking
====================
- University group project (2 members)
- Developed using C++ and OpenCV library
- Tennis ball is distinguished based on the positions of the moving objects in the previous and next frame
- Algorithm was implemented based on http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/CVSSP/Publications/papers/yan-bmvc2005.pdf
- However, our own experimentations were conducted as several dependencies were not satisfied (limited resources)
